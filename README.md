Spark SQL

In this project, I used SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. 
Then I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, 
and verify that the table has been uncached.
I also comapred the runtimes of a SQL query on uncached, cached and parquet data.
